    <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr>
    <h3>1. <u>KGF 1 and 2</u></h3>
    <p>
        KGF Chapter 1 follows the journey of Rocky, a fearless and ambitious man who rises from poverty 
        in the streets of Mumbai to become a powerful gangster. His mission takes him to the Kolar Gold
        Fields (KGF), a brutal and secretive gold mine ruled by oppressive forces. Rocky infiltrates KGF 
        to fulfill a promise to his dying mother — to become the most powerful man. The film ends with 
        Rocky killing the tyrant Garuda, setting the stage for a new era.

        KGF Chapter 2 continues Rocky’s story as he becomes the ruler of KGF. With great power comes 
        bigger enemies — including the fierce Prime Minister Ramika Sen and ruthless crime lords like
        Adheera. Rocky must defend his empire while staying true to his mother’s dream. The sequel dives
        deeper into politics, betrayal, and power struggles, with grand action and emotional depth. 
        It concludes with shocking twists and the legend of Rocky growing even larger.

    <h3>2. <u>Munna Bhai MBBS</u></h3>
    <p>
        Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. (2003) is a heartwarming comedy-drama about Munna, a lovable Mumbai gangster 
        who pretends to be a doctor to fulfill his father’s dream. When the truth is exposed, he decides 
        to actually join a medical college to prove himself. With his street-smart ways and big heart, 
        Munna challenges the rigid and cold system of medical education. He brings laughter, empathy, 
        and humanity to the hospital, showing that healing is more than just medicine — it’s about 
        kindness and love.

    <h3>3. <u>3 idiots</u></h3>
    <p>
        3 Idiots is an inspiring and emotional story about three engineering students — Rancho, Farhan, 
        and Raju — navigating life at a strict and competitive college in India. Rancho, the most 
        unconventional of them, questions the education system and encourages his friends to follow 
        their passion instead of blindly chasing success. Through humor, struggle, and friendship, the 
        film highlights the pressure students face, the flaws in the system, and the power of learning 
        with curiosity. It ends with a powerful message: “Chase excellence, and success will follow.”
