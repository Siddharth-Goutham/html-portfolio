   <p> I am someone who doesn’t just move through the world — I question it, build within it, and seek deeper meaning in every experience. With a balance of technical thinking and creative curiosity, I move easily between logic and imagination. Whether I’m writing code, exploring the beauty of anime art, or reflecting on India’s rich cultural roots, I approach everything with thoughtfulness and intention. I’m not afraid to ask the questions others might skip. I prefer to dive beneath the surface — in academics, in stories, and in life — always looking for what’s real and meaningful.</p>

<p>There’s a quiet confidence in me that doesn’t need to be loud to leave a mark. I value clarity, precision, and honesty in the way I think, speak, and connect with people. My focus isn’t only on achieving success but on understanding the world around me. I believe in growing through awareness and staying true to myself. In that journey, I stand out — not by imitating others, but by becoming more of who I am meant to be.</p>
